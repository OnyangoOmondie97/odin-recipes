<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Roman dish made with eggs, Pecorino Romano, guanciale, and black pepper. The creamy sauce is not made with cream, but rather with eggs and cheese, offering a delightful taste sensation.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>400g of spaghetti</li>
    <li>100g of guanciale or pancetta, diced</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>A pinch of parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente.</li>
    <li>In a skillet, cook the guanciale or pancetta over medium heat until it becomes crispy. Add garlic for flavor.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and some black pepper until well combined.</li>
    <li>Drain the spaghetti, reserving about a cup of pasta water. Add the pasta to the skillet with guanciale/pancetta.</li>
    <li>Remove skillet from heat, and quickly pour in the egg mixture, combining quickly to create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water if needed.</li>
    <li>Season with salt, more black pepper, and parsley. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino on the side.</li>
</ol>
