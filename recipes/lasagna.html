            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dried basil</li>
            <li>½ cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps to prepare the dish -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions, sautéing until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef or turkey to the pan. Cook until browned, breaking up the meat as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half of the mozzarella cheese, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Place 3 lasagna sheets over the sauce. Spread a portion of the cheese mixture over the pasta sheets, then top with a layer of the meat sauce. Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the top layer.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 25 minutes, remove the foil and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes or until the cheese on top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for about 10 minutes before serving. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to cut and serve.</li>
            <li>Serve with a side of salad or garlic bread, and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
        </ol>
